## Migrating data from IBM Rational DOORS to IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation

### PublishedAt: 2015-12-16T20:53:02Z

### Tags: ['yianna', 'papadakis', 'kantos', 'rational', 'doors', 'rdng', 'next', 'generation', 'migration', 'ibm']

### Description:
With the release of IBM Rational DOORS 9.6.1.4 and IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation V6.0.1 the migration has been optimized, now automatically creating a global type system and artifact types in IBM Rational DOORS Next Generation, considering the commonalities of the type system defined in modules within DOORS, as well as links relationships. In addition, you can now incrementally migrate a project, and the two applications will automatically maintain and update link relationships with every incremental migration.    
   
Migration is not interchange of data where data can go from one tool to another and possibly back again.  Migration is a one-way move from Rational DOORS to Rational DOORS Next generation, with traceability back to the source.   
  
Using a migration package, migration can include one or more modules and can be incremental, migrating a little at a time, and only what you need.  The current version of modules is migrated along with internal external and OSLC links,  OLE objects, pictures and so forth.    
The history of the migrated data is not migrated  however, the migration creates links in Rational DOORS Next Generation that link back to the corresponding records in Rational DOORS.  
The links provides access to history, baselines, and other non-migrated data. By migrating only current data, you preserve all history and audit information in Rational DOORS  
and eliminate the cost of migrating and revalidating audits and historical data in Rational DOORS Next Generation.  
Visit the Knowledge Center for details on the migration process.

### PublishedAt: 2016-08-16T19:13:06Z

### Tags: ['Rational', 'CLM', 'IoTCE', 'configuration management', 'global configurations']

### Description:
With configuration management enabled, you can control change through (optionally mandated) use of change sets that isolate your changes from the main working stream. You can also require that change sets be linked to change requests, before delivering to the main stream for others to see and use.  Links to artifacts such as tests can be marked valid or invalid automatically or explicitly, to communicate changes to potentially impacted parties.

### Description:
In this demonstration, we will see how we can design, monitor and improve connected systems utilizing the IBM platform for building and managing IoT solutions.  We will take a look at how we can augment traditional systems engineering with designing for analytics. That is defining monitors and the key data points we want to monitor once a system is deployed.  And then feeding the insight we can gain by analyzing that data back into engineering in order to make our connected systems faster, safer, more reliable, more secure and more optimized. In a sense, enabling a feedback loop around engineering, deployment and operations to continuously fine tune, calibrate and improve our connected systems.

## Report Builder: Generating alternate queries to filter on artifacts before scoping by projects

### PublishedAt: 2020-12-11T18:51:55Z

### Tags: ['IBM', 'Jazz Reporting Service', 'JRS', 'Report Builder', 'LQE', 'Lifecycle Query Engine', 'alternate queries', 'SPARQL queries', 'large project optimization', 'optimizing queries', 'optimizing reports']

### Description:
You can now generate an alternative SPARQL query for reports to filter on artifacts before scoping by projects.  
  
You can select the Defer scoping by projects with an alternative query checkbox to generate an alternative query when the data source is Lifecycle Query Engine or Lifecycle Query Engine scoped by a configuration. This option is helpful when your report data has a large number of projects in the "Limit the scope" section.  
  
For more information, see Optimizing reports (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYMRC_7.0.2/com.ibm.team.jp.jrs.doc/topics/t_jrs_create_reports.html#task_optimize).

### PublishedAt: 2020-12-11T19:12:29Z

### Tags: ['IBM', 'Jazz Reporting Service', 'JRS', 'Report Builder', 'reports', 'searching records', 'search reports', 'search schedules', 'search', 'search functionality']

### Description:
The Type to filter text box in Report Builder is replaced with the Search text box and Click to search icon. The enhanced search functionality now retrieves tags, folders, reports, schedules, or results that are nested within collapsed groups. Earlier, only records outside groups or within expanded tags or folders in the My reports, All reports, My schedules, All schedules, My results, and All results pages were displayed in the search results. For instance, if a report was within a tag or folder that was in a collapsed state, then the report was not displayed in the search results.
